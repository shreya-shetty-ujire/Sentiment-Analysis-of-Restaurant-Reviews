Overview:
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews using advanced machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP). By analyzing customer sentiments extracted from unstructured text data, the goal is to gain valuable insights into customer experiences and preferences within the restaurant industry.

**Key Features:**

**Data Analysis:** The project delves deep into analyzing customer sentiment in restaurant reviews and exploring its relationship with various factors, including price range.

**Sentiment Categorization**

**NLP Methodologies:** Leveraging NLP methodologies, meaningful insights are extracted from unstructured text data to enhance understanding of customer sentiments.

**Addressing Data Imbalance:** Data imbalance is addressed using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and a deep learning model to perform sentiment analysis and predict sentiment from review text.

**Clustering Analysis:** The association between sentiment and price range is investigated through clustering using the K-means algorithm, revealing intriguing patterns and distinct customer segments.
